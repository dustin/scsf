<h1>Grant Program</h1>

<p>
The Santa Clara Schools Foundation makes grants to
<acronym title="Santa Clara Unified School District">SCUSD</acronym> district
classroom teachers for learning materials, equipment, programs and activities
that directly benefit our students.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to provide assistance to programs that encourage quality academic
performance, give students hands-on experiences, and promote their interest in
learning.
</p>

<p>
Grants are made available through a selective applications process.  After a
grant proposal has been received, the grant award decision is made by the Santa
Clara Schools Foundation Board of Directors.
</p>

<h2>Grant Policy and Award Policy </h2>
<p>
The Foundation encourages grant requests from all schools and a broad range of staff so that awards may be distributed as equitably as possible throughout the district.  The Grant submission deadline is the end of the month prior to regular monthly Board meetings.  Application at least 60 days in advance of the month of need is recommended to assure timely consideration.  You can either <a href="/contact/">send in</a>
a grant request using our <a href="/media/grant.pdf">offline form</a> or or use
our <a href="/grant/new/">online form</a> to apply right now.
</p>

<p>
Grant request must meet the requirements stipulated on the Application and include principal signature indicating awareness of the request. Application should include description of efforts to obtain funding or support from other sources. Instructional materials requested should meet district academic standards and not displace district-provided or district recommended materials.
</p>
<p>
Support for field trips and science camp will be awarded based on need (i.e., funding for students unable to afford cost).
Applicant requesting technology should first determine if the request can be met through donations solicited from local companies by district or school (technology donations contact is Roger Barnes).
</p>
<p>
In making grant decisions, the Board may consider the extent to which a school or individual staff member has previously received Foundation support. Grants will not be made for foreign travel, stipends, or salaries.
